This is the source code for the Template Toolkit web site.

You will need to have the following modules installed (and perhaps some
others too that I've missed):

    Template
    AppConfig
    Path::Class
    File::Find::Rule
    Pod::POM

Start by running the `bin/configure` script:

    $ bin/configure

This processes the templates in the `skeleton` directory to create the
`bin/build` script, the `etc/ttree.cfg` configuration file and a
default configuration file for the Apache web server in
`etc/httpd.conf.default'.

The site is built from templates in the `templates/pages` directory.
The `templates/library` directory contains other template components.
The `bin/build` script is a wrapper around `tree` to build the site.

    $ bin/build

You can pass any `ttree` options to the script on the command line.
For example, the build all pages regardless of timestamps:

    $ bin/build -a

For further information on the options:

    $ bin/build -h

The generated HTML pages are written to the `html` directory.

The HTML documentation for the Template Toolkit is generated from the
POD documentation.  The `bin/podmods` script should be used as the first
step.

Specify a path to the `lib` directory of a Template Toolkit distribution
as a command line argument:

    $ bin/podmods /path/to/a/copy/of/Template2/lib/

This converts the POD documentation in the Perl modules into HTML page
templates that are written to the `templates/pages/docs/` directory.

It also generates the following YAML files that contain page metadata
for the documentation pages:

    metadata/docs/modules.yaml
    metadata/docs/pages.yaml
    metadata/docs/sections.yaml

Note that this generates page templates rather than the final HTML
pages.  You will then need to run the `bin/build` script again to
convert any new documentation templates to their final HTML pages.

    $ bin/build

The `templates/pages/about.html` pages is generated from the POD
documentation in `pod/about.pod`.

    $ bin/pod2html pod/about.pod > templates/pages/about.html

You will also need to run the `bin/build` script again to convert
the `templates/pages/about.html` template to the equivalent HTML
page in `html/about.html`.

    $ bin/build
