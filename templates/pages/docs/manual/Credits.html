      The Template Toolkit began its life as the <code>Text::MetaText</code>
      module, originally released to CPAN around 1996. This itself was the
      public manifestation of an earlier template processing system I developed
      while working at Peritas (now Knowledge Pool -
      http://www.knowledgepool.com/)
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Text::MetaText</code> was the prototype - the one we always planned
      to throw away. It did the job well, showing us what worked and what
      didn't, what was good and what was bad, and gave us some ideas about what
      could be done better, given the chance to start again from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time late in 1998 I threw away the prototype and started work on the
      Template Toolkit. By then I was working at Canon Research Centre Europe
      Ltd. (CRE), involved in a general research programme related to web
      publishing and dynamic content generation. The first alpha release was in
      June 1999, followed by numerous more alpha and beta releases culminating
      in 1.00 being released on 2nd December 1999.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month or so later, work had begun on version 2.00. The plan was to get
      the template language relatively stable in version 1.00 and not worry too
      much about performance or other internal matters. Then, version 2.00
      would follow to improve performance, clean up the architecture and fix
      anything that, with the benefit of hindsight, we thought could be
      improved. As it happens, me starting work on version 2.00 coincided with
      Doug Steinwand sending me his parser variant which compiled templates to
      Perl code, giving a major performance boost. As well as the speedups,
      there are a whole host of significant new features in version 2.00, and a
      greatly improved internal architecture. Apart from a few minor "fixups"
      the template directives and language have remained the same as in version
      1.00
    </p>
    <p>
      Version 2.00 was available in beta release form in July 2000, just in
      time for the 4th Perl Conference where version 1.00 was awarded "Best New
      Perl Module". After another extended beta release period, version 2.00
      was released on 1st December 2000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version 3 has been in development ever since.
