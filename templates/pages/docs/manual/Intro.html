      The Template Toolkit is a collection of Perl modules which implement a
      fast, flexible, powerful and extensible template processing system. It is
      most often used for generating dynamic web content, although it can be
      used equally well for processing any kind of text documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the simplest level it provides an easy way to process template files,
      filling in embedded variable references with their equivalent values.
      Here's an example of a template.
    </p>
    <pre>
      Dear <span class="tt">[% name %]</span>,
      
      It has come to our attention that your account is in 
      arrears to the sum of <span class="tt">[% debt %]</span>.
      
      Please settle your account before <span class="tt">[% deadline %]</span> or we 
      will be forced to revoke your Licence to Thrill.
      
      The Management.
    </pre>
    <p>
      By default, template directives are embedded within the character
      sequences <code>[%</code> ... <code>%]</code> but you can change these
      and various other options to configure how the Template Toolkit looks,
      feels and works. You can set the <code>INTERPOLATE</code> option, for
      example, if you prefer to embed your variables in Perl style:
    </p>
    <pre>
      Dear $name,
      
      It has come to our attention that your account is in 
      arrears to the sum of $debt.
    </pre>
    <pre>
      ...etc...
    </pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="[** ttmodlink('Template') **]">Template</a> Perl module is
      the front end to the Template Toolkit for Perl programmers, providing
      access to the full range of functionality through a single module with a
      simple interface. It loads the other modules as required and instantiates
      a default set of objects to handle subsequent template processing
      requests. Configuration parameters may be passed to the <a href="[**
      ttmodlink('Template') **]">Template</a> constructor method, <a href="[**
      ttmodlink('Template') **]#method_new">new()</a>, which are then used to
      configure the generate object.
    </p>
    <pre>
      use Template;
      
      my $tt = Template-&gt;new({
          INCLUDE_PATH =&gt; '/usr/local/templates',
          INTERPOLATE  =&gt; 1,
      }) || die "$Template::ERROR\n";
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <a href="[** ttmodlink('Template') **]">Template</a> object
      implements a <a href="[** ttmodlink('Template')
      **]#method_process">process()</a> method for processing template files or
      text. The name of the input template (or various other sources) is passed
      as the first argument, followed by a reference to a hash array of
      variable definitions for substitution in the template.
    </p>
    <pre>
      my $vars = {
          name     =&gt; 'Count Edward van Halen',
          debt     =&gt; '3 riffs and a solo',
          deadline =&gt; 'the next chorus',
      };
      
      $tt-&gt;process('letters/overdrawn', $vars)
          || die $tt-&gt;error(), "\n";
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <a href="[** ttmodlink('Template') **]#method_process">process()</a>
      method returns a true value (<code>1</code>) on success and prints the
      template output to <code>STDOUT</code>, by default. On error, the <a
      href="[** ttmodlink('Template') **]#method_process">process()</a> method
      returns a false value (<code>undef</code>). The <a href="[**
      ttmodlink('Template') **]#method_error">error()</a> method can then be
      called to retrieve details of the error.
    </p>

[** WRAPPER page/section title='Component Based Content Construction' id='section_Component_Based_Content_Construction' -**]
    <p>
      A number of special directives are provided, such as <code>INSERT</code>,
      <code>INCLUDE</code> and <code>PROCESS</code>, which allow content to be
      built up from smaller template components. This permits a modular
      approach to building a web site or other content repository, promoting
      reusability, cross-site consistency, ease of construction and subsequent
      maintenance. Common elements such as headers, footers, menu bars, tables,
      and so on, can be created as separate template files which can then be
      processed into other documents as required. All defined variables are
      inherited by these templates along with any additional "local" values
      specified.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <span class="tt">[% PROCESS header 
           title = "The Cat Sat on the Mat"
      %]</span>
      
      <span class="tt">[% PROCESS menu %]</span>
      
      The location of the missing feline has now been established.
      Thank you for your assistance.
      
      <span class="tt">[% INSERT legal/disclaimer %]</span>
      
      <span class="tt">[% PROCESS footer %]</span>
    </pre>
    <p>
      You can also define a template as a BLOCK within the same file and
      PROCESS it just like any other template file. This can be invaluable for
      building up repetitive elements such as tables, menus, etc.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <span class="tt">[% BLOCK tabrow %]</span>
         &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;<span class="tt">[% name %]</span>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;<span class="tt">[% email %]</span>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
      <span class="tt">[% END %]</span>
      
      &lt;table&gt;
      <span class="tt">[% PROCESS tabrow name="tom"   email="tom@here.org"    %]</span>
      <span class="tt">[% PROCESS tabrow name="dick"  email="disk@there.org"  %]</span>
      <span class="tt">[% PROCESS tabrow name="larry" email="larry@where.org" %]</span>

[** WRAPPER page/section title='Data and Code Binding' id='section_Data_and_Code_Binding' -**]
    <p>
      One of the key features that sets the Template Toolkit apart from other
      template processors is the ability to bind template variables to any kind
      of Perl data: scalars, lists, hash arrays, sub-routines and objects.
    </p>
    <pre>
      my $vars = {
          root   =&gt; 'http://here.com/there',
          menu   =&gt; [ 'modules', 'authors', 'scripts' ],
          client =&gt; {
              name =&gt; 'Doctor Joseph von Satriani',
              id   =&gt; 'JVSAT',
          },
          checkout =&gt; sub { my $total = shift; ...; return $something },
          shopcart =&gt; My::Cool::Shopping::Cart-&gt;new(),
      };
    </pre>
    <p>
      The Template Toolkit will automatically Do The Right Thing to access the
      data in an appropriate manner to return some value which can then be
      output. The dot operator '<code>.</code>' is used to access into lists
      and hashes or to call object methods. The <code>FOREACH</code> directive
      is provided for iterating through lists, and various logical tests are
      available using directives such as <code>IF</code>, <code>UNLESS</code>,
      <code>ELSIF</code>, <code>ELSE</code>, <code>SWITCH</code>,
      <code>CASE</code>, etc.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <span class="tt">[% FOREACH section = menu %]</span>
         &lt;a href="<span class="tt">[% root %]</span>/<span class="tt">[% section %]</span>/index.html"&gt;<span class="tt">[% section %]</span>&lt;/a&gt;
      <span class="tt">[% END %]</span>
      
      &lt;b&gt;Client&lt;/a&gt;: <span class="tt">[% client.name %]</span> (id: <span class="tt">[% client.id %]</span>)
      
      <span class="tt">[% IF shopcart.nitems %]</span>
         Your shopping cart contains the following items:
         &lt;ul&gt;
         <span class="tt">[% FOREACH item = shopcart.contents %]</span>
           &lt;li&gt;<span class="tt">[% item.name %]</span> : <span class="tt">[% item.qty %]</span> @ <span class="tt">[% item.price %]</span>
         <span class="tt">[% END %]</span>
         &lt;/ul&gt;
         
         <span class="tt">[% checkout(shopcart.total) %]</span>
         
      <span class="tt">[% ELSE %]</span>
         No items currently in shopping cart.
      <span class="tt">[% END %]</span>

    <p>
      The Template Toolkit also provides a number of additional directives for
      advanced processing and programmatical functionality. It supports output
      filters (FILTER), allows custom macros to be defined (MACRO), has a
      fully-featured exception handling system (TRY, THROW, CATCH, FINAL) and
      supports a plugin architecture (USE) which allows special plugin modules
      and even regular Perl modules to be loaded and used with the minimum of
      fuss. The Template Toolkit is "just" a template processor but you can
      trivially extend it to incorporate the functionality of any Perl module
      you can get your hands on. Thus, it is also a scalable and extensible
      template framework, ideally suited for managing the presentation layer
      for application servers, content management systems and other web
      applications.
    </p>
[** END -**]
[** WRAPPER page/section title='Separating Presentation and Application Logic' id='section_Separating_Presentation_and_Application_Logic' -**]
    <p>
      Rather than embedding Perl code or some other scripting language directly
      into template documents, it encourages you to keep functional components
      (i.e. Perl code) separate from presentation components (e.g. HTML
      templates). The template variables provide the interface between the two
      layers, allowing data to be generated in code and then passed to a
      template component for displaying (pipeline model) or for sub-routine or
      object references to be bound to variables which can then be called from
      the template as and when required (callback model).
    </p>
    <p>
      The directives that the Template Toolkit provide implement their own mini
      programming language, but they're not really designed for serious,
      general purpose programming. Perl is a far more appropriate language for
      that. If you embed application logic (e.g. Perl or other scripting
      language fragments) in HTML templates then you risk losing the clear
      separation of concerns between functionality and presentation. It becomes
      harder to maintain the two elements in isolation and more difficult, if
      not impossible, to reuse code or presentation elements by themselves. It
      is far better to write your application code in separate Perl modules,
      libraries or scripts and then use templates to control how the resulting
      data is presented as output. Thus you should think of the Template
      Toolkit language as a set of layout directives for displaying data, not
      calculating it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said that, the Template Toolkit doesn't force you into one
      approach or the other. It attempts to be pragmatic rather than dogmatic
      in allowing you to do whatever best gets the job done. Thus, if you
      enable the EVAL_PERL option then you can happily embed real Perl code in
      your templates within PERL ... END directives.
    </p>

[** WRAPPER page/section title='Performance' id='section_Performance' -**]
    <p>
      The Template Toolkit uses a fast YACC-like parser which compiles
      templates into Perl code for maximum runtime efficiency. It also has an
      advanced caching mechanism which manages in-memory and on-disk (i.e.
      persistent) versions of compiled templates. The modules that comprise the
      toolkit are highly configurable and the architecture around which they're
      built is designed to be extensible. The Template Toolkit provides a
      powerful framework around which content creation and delivery systems can
      be built while also providing a simple interface through the Template
      front-end module for general use.
