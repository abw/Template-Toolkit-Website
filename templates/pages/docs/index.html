    <p>
      The Template Toolkit is a collection of Perl modules which implement a
      fast, flexible, powerful and extensible template processing system.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is "input-agnostic" and can be used equally well for processing any
      kind of text documents: HTML, XML, CSS, Javascript, Perl code, plain
      text, and so on. However, it is most often used for generating static and
      dynamic web content, so that's what we'll focus on here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the Template Toolkit is written in Perl, you don't need to be a
      Perl programmer to use it. It was designed to allow non-programmers to
      easily create and maintain template-based web sites without having to
      mess around writing Perl code or going crazy with cut-n-paste.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the Template Toolkit is also designed to be extremely flexible
      and extensible. If you are a Perl programmer, or know someone who is,
      then you can easily hook the Template Toolkit into your existing code,
      data, databases and web applications. Furthermore, you can easily extend
      the Template Toolkit through the use of its plugin mechanism and other
      developer APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever context you use it in, the primary purpose of the Template
      Toolkit is to allow you to create a clear separation between the
      presentation elements of your web site and everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're generating static web pages, then you can use it to separate
      the commonly repeated user interface elements on each page (headers,
      menus, footers, etc.) from the core content. If you're generating dynamic
      web pages for the front end of a web application, then you'll also be
      using it to keep the back-end Perl code entirely separate from the
      front-end HTML templates. Either way, a <i>clear separation of
      concerns</i> is what allow you to concentrate on one thing at a time
      without the other things getting in your way. And that's what the
      Template Toolkit is all about.

[** WRAPPER page/section title='Documentation' id='section_Documentation' -**]
    <p>
      The documentation for the Template Toolkit is organised into five
      sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="[** ttmodlink('Template::Manual') **]">Template::Manual</a>
      contains detailed information about using the Template Toolkit. It gives
      examples of its use and includes a full reference of the template
      language, configuration options, filters, plugins and other component
      parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="[** ttmodlink('Template::Modules')
      **]">Template::Modules</a> page lists the Perl modules that comprise the
      Template Toolkit. It gives a brief explanation of what each of them does,
      and provides a link to the complete documentation for each module for
      further information. If you're a Perl programmer looking to use the
      Template Toolkit from your Perl programs then this section is likely to
      be of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most, if not all of the information you need to call the Template Toolkit
      from Perl is in the documentation for the <a href="[**
      ttmodlink('Template') **]">Template</a> module. You only really need to
      start thinking about the other modules if you want to extend or modify
      the Template Toolkit in some way, or if you're interested in looking
      under the hood to see how it all works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The documentation for each module is embedded as POD in each module, so
      you can always use <code>perldoc</code> from the command line to read a
      module's documentation. e.g.
    </p>
    <pre>
      $ perldoc Template
      $ perldoc Template::Context
        ...etc...
    </pre>
    <p>
      It's worth noting that all the other documentation, including the user
      manual is available as POD. e.g.
    </p>
    <pre>
      $ perldoc Template::Manual
      $ perldoc Template::Manual::Config
        ...etc...
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <a href="[** ttmodlink('Template::Tools') **]">Template::Tools</a>
      section contains the documentation for <a
      href="#section_tpage">Template::Tools::tpage</a> and <a
      href="#section_ttree">Template::Tools::ttree</a>. These are two command
      line programs that are distributed with the Template Toolkit. <a
      href="[** ttmodlink('Template::Tools::tpage') **]">tpage</a> is used to
      process a single template file, <a href="[**
      ttmodlink('Template::Tools::ttree') **]">ttree</a> for processing entire
      directories of template files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="[** ttmodlink('Template::Tutorial')
      **]">Template::Tutorial</a> section contains two introductory tutorials
      on using the Template Toolkit. The first is <a href="[**
      ttmodlink('Template::Tutorial::Web') **]">Template::Tutorial::Web</a> on
      generating web content. The second is <a href="[**
      ttmodlink('Template::Tutorial::Datafile')
      **]">Template::Tutorial::Datafile</a> on using the Template Toolkit to
      generate other data formats including XML.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final section of the manual is <a href="[**
      ttmodlink('Template::FAQ') **]">Template::FAQ</a> which contains answers
      to some of the Frequently Asked Questions about the Template Toolkit.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can read the documentation in HTML format either online at the
      Template Toolkit web site, <a
      href="http://template-toolkit.org/">http://template-toolkit.org/</a>, or
      by downloading the HTML version of the documentation from <a
      href="http://template-toolkit.org/download/index.html#html_docs">http://template-toolkit.org/download/index.html#html_docs</a>
      and unpacking it on your local machine.
